# Nibblet
A libre, open-source implementation of Minecraft Java Edition's NBT data format.  

This implementation is _not_ based off any other implementation (_especially_ not Minecraft's own - that would be illegal!)  
Instead, it's been written for scratch, with the only reference used being the [wiki.vg page on the NBT format](https://wiki.vg/NBT).

**NOTE:** This library does _not_ support reading or writing the (slightly different) NBT format used by Bedrock Edition.
