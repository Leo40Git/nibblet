# Nibblet
A libre, open-source implementation of Minecraft's NBT data format (both Java Edition's and Bedrock Edition's formats).  

This implementation is _not_ based off any other implementation (_especially_ not Minecraft's own - that would be illegal!)  
Instead, it's been written for scratch, with the only reference used being the [wiki.vg page on the NBT format](https://wiki.vg/NBT)
(and a guy in the Bedrock OSS Discord server who I asked about root lists. Thanks, Huntondoom!).
